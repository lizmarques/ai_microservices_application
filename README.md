# The Efficiency of Microservices Architecture for AI Applications

A comprehensive microservices-based platform that demonstrates the efficiency of microservices architecture for AI applications, providing Speech-to-Text (STT), Large Language Model (LLM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. The application is fully containerized using Docker and includes monitoring, load balancing, and performance testing to demonstrate architectural efficiency.

> **Note**: While the main goal is to evaluate the efficiency of microservices architecture for AI applications, a user-friendly Streamlit frontend has been built to allow people to interact with the application and experience the complete AI workflow in real-time.

## 🧪 Experimental Methodology & Results

This research follows an **exploratory and quantitative experimental design**, evaluating the **efficiency and scalability** of a real-time AI application based on a **microservices architecture**.  
The system enables human–machine interaction through live speech, leveraging three core services:

- **STT (Speech-to-Text)** – transcribes the user’s audio input  
- **LLM (Large Language Model)** – generates textual responses  
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** – converts text back into synthesized speech  

Each service runs independently and communicates through REST APIs managed by an **API Gateway** (Traefik). Every microservice has its own database—**PostgreSQL** for structured data and **MongoDB** for LLM responses—following the *database-per-service* pattern to ensure autonomy and isolation.  
All services are containerized via **Docker Compose**, allowing horizontal and vertical scalability.

---

### ⚙️ Experimental Setup

Performance tests were executed with **Locust**, simulating real-time requests to measure:
- Total pipeline latency (STT → LLM → TTS)  
- Individual service latency  
- Throughput (Requests per Second – RPS)  
- Error rate and stability under load  

Two controlled scenarios were evaluated using the same input prompt in portuguese, **“Quem fundou a Apple? (Who founded Apple?)”**, to ensure consistency.

---

## 📈 Performance Results

### **Scenario 1 – Low Load (10 Concurrent Users)**

This baseline test evaluated latency and overhead under light traffic.  
The system processed requests smoothly, maintaining an average total latency **below 1.5 seconds** with **no failed requests**.  
The API Gateway introduced minimal overhead (<100ms), and REST communication proved efficient.

  <em>Figure 3 – Response Times (Low Load)</em>
</p>


✅ **Key Findings**  
- Consistent latency and stability across all services  
- No observed bottlenecks  
- REST-based communication and API Gateway overhead negligible  

---

### **Scenario 2 – High Load (500 Concurrent Users)**

The stress test simulated high concurrency to evaluate scalability and fault tolerance.  
Throughput peaked at **~30 requests per second**, stabilizing after approximately 3 minutes.  
However, **STT** emerged as the main bottleneck due to higher computational demands, resulting in increased latency and temporary saturation.

  <em>Figure 6 – Total Failures per Endpoint (High Load)</em>
</p>

✅ **Key Findings**  
- The **STT** service reached latency peaks (~10s) during initial load spikes, confirming it as the main computational bottleneck  
- The **LLM** and **TTS** services maintained stable performance  
- The **API Gateway** added slight latency overhead under heavy load but remained operational  
- The system sustained **~30 RPS** after stabilization, validating the architecture’s scalability potential  

---

### 📊 Summary

| Metric | Scenario 1 (Low Load) | Scenario 2 (High Load) |
|:--|:--:|:--:|
| Average Pipeline Latency | < 1.5 s | 3–4 s (after stabilization) |
| API Gateway Overhead | < 100 ms | < 250 ms |
| Throughput | 1–3 RPS | ~30 RPS |
| Success Rate | 100% | 95–97% (temporary errors during spikes) |
| Main Bottleneck | None | STT service |

---

### 🧠 Interpretation

- The **modular microservices architecture** proved efficient and resilient under both light and heavy load conditions.  
- **Independent databases and containerization** contributed to isolation and recoverability.  
- **STT performance** directly influenced total pipeline latency, suggesting optimization or asynchronous queuing strategies (e.g., Celery) could further enhance scalability.
